# DiseaseDetection
The project aims to provide users with a platform to input their symptoms and receive a diagnosis for the disease they might be suffering from. Additionally, users must add their names before checking for their potential disease. Alongside the diagnosis, users will be informed about the specialty of the doctor who can treat their condition.
