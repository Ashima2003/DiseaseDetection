# DiseaseDetection
The project aims to provide users with a platform to input their symptoms and receive a diagnosis for the disease they might be suffering from. Additionally, users must add their names before checking for their potential disease. Alongside the diagnosis, users will be informed about the specialty of the doctor who can treat their condition.
# Training.csv
This is the main dataset which has been used in this project. This dataset consist of mainly two columns "Disease" and "Symptoms" but this dataset is preprocessed so it helps in easily clasifying the data. This dataset is used to train our model.
# Testing.csv
This is the dataset which has been used to test our model so that we can know the accuracy of our model. this dataset is predefined with output.
## Working of Project
# Step 1-
Enter the name in the provided space infront of the label as "Name of the Patient". It is the mandatory field which user have to enter in order to get result.
# Step 2-

If user is not aware of 5 symptoms then it is mandatory for him to enter atleast 2 starting systems, otherwise the result will not come and a message box will pop up for the same.
# Step 3-
User can predict the disease using Decision tree algorithm. Set the time in set time textbox. It will only accept time in HH:MM format. Click on the button 'Analyse'.
# Step 4-
Users will find disease recommendations adjacent to their choice. A pop-up window will promptly display available doctors specializing in the recommended disease.
